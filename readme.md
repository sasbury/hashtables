## Hashtables ##

A couple of hash table implementations in Java, Objective-C (old NeXT Objective-C that is) and Go that all use the same basic structure I put these together for a [blog post](http://www.sasbury.com/notes/2015/hashtables.html).

This code is not in the right context to compile, but should be reusable.
